# Zillow-Home-Values
Exploratory Data Analysis of Zillow Home Value Index for U.S. cities, 2000 - 2025.
This project uses Zillow Home Value Index data from their website: https.
Data is downloadable in the https://www.zillow.com/research/data/ site, by scrolling down to Data, and selecting ZHVI All Homes (SFR,Condo/Co-op) Time Series, Smoothed, Seasonally Adjusted ($), and filtering for City in the Geography section
I used it to compare average house values during the last 10 years across the country. 

- I found that LA, Miami, and New York have the highest housing costs
- States like Selma, Alabama and St. Louis , Missouri had the lowest housing costs
- immeditaley after the Covid-19 pandemic, in 2020, the avergae change in price increased by about $19,000, but then dropped after 2022 by about $28,593. This sharp increase and sharp decrease indicates that that home values during the Covid-19 pandemic appracited in value but did not stay that way.
