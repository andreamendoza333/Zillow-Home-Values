# Zillow-Home-Values
Exploratory Data Analysis of Zillow Home Value Index for U.S. cities, 2000 - 2025.
This project uses Zillow Home Value Index data from their website: https://www.zillow.com/research/data/

I used it to compare average house values during the last 10 years across the country. 

I found that LA, Miami, and New York have the highest housing costs, while other states like Selma, Alabama and St. Louis , Missouri had the lowest housing costs. 

This project uses Python code and the packages Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib
